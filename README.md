This is a country app built with flutter which makes use of the Rest country API. It uses API calls to search, fetch and display a list of all available countries and certain information about each of them.
Int the info screen, information about the countries are shown including their flags and coat of arms.
The app also makes use of GetX for state management to share data received from the API call to various parts of the application.
